# Approximate-8x8-multiplier-designs
Approxiamate multipliers are used in a wide range if error tolerant applications where speed and power consumptions is prirotised over accuracy.
\
This project presents 8x8 multipliers made using 4, 4x4 multipliers.\
Design 0 is an exact 8x8 multiplier made using 4 exact Wallace tree multipliers.\
Design 1 uses three exact Wallace tree multipliers and one approximate 4x4 multiplier as the least significant 4x4 multiplier.\
Design 2 uses two exact Wallace tree multipliers and two approximate 4x4 multipliers as the two least significant 4x4 multipliers.\
Design 3 uses one exact Wallace tree multiplier and three approximate 4x4 multipliers as the three least significant 4x4 multipliers.\
Design 4 is an 8x8 multiplier using only approximate 4x4 multiplier.\
