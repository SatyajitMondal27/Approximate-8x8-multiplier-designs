# Approximate-8x8-multiplier-designs
In this 4x4 approximate multiplier we use the stage two and stage 3 4:2 compressors to calculation the stage 2 and stage 3 sum of partial products during multiplication.\
In accurate multipliers XOR gates comsume more power and provide larger delays when compared to AND and OR gates.\
Hence the motive of ceating this approximate multiplier is to remove the use of XOR gates and compensate for accurcay with higher power and speed.
