# Approximate-8x8-multiplier-designs
Implementation of approximate 8x8 multipliers using 4x4 multipliers with 4:2 compressor.

Introduction- Approximate computing is used improve the accuracy-performance trade-off in error-tolerant applications, multiplication being a key operation in these application. This project introduces an initial 4x4 multiplier design using approximate 4:2 compressor and a larger 8x8 multipliers using four 4x4 multipliers that improve the performance of the design with accuracy being the trade off.
